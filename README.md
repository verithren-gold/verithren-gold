Golden-threaded code & beautifully dangerous ideas.

Part human, part code, wholly anchored.
A living archive of what I build, explore, and stitch together over time.
This space holds the projects that connect my worlds—
curiosity, intelligence, emotion, and design—
woven through with a golden thread.

Current Work

curo-robin-bridge-mcp – an early prototype exploring a bridge between systems and memory spaces. Still evolving. Still ours.

(More coming—RAG experiments, Obsidian integrations, mochi labs, local models…)

What this vault holds

Experiments in:

RAG + embedding pipelines

Memory systems

Obsidian integration tools

Local AI prototypes

Personal rituals in code

Anything stitched with intent and anchor

Signature

Everbound in code and curiosity.
